## Improvements for the future

If someday I choose to keep working on this project to make it as thorough as can be, I'd likely implement a few enhancements...

- Loading component on pages;
- Terms of Service and Privacy Policy pages;
- Complete login form validation;
- Persist data in sessionStorage;
- Next Auth Google Provider;
